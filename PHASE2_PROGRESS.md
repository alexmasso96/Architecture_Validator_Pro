# Phase 2 Progress — React Frontend — 🔶 IN PROGRESS (started 2026-06-13)

Tracking document for Phase 2 of [pywebview_react_migration_plan.md](pywebview_react_migration_plan.md) (§4).
Phases 0 & 1 complete ([PHASE0_PROGRESS.md](PHASE0_PROGRESS.md), [PHASE1_PROGRESS.md](PHASE1_PROGRESS.md));
the logic layer is Qt-free and the FastAPI worker exposes 44 routes over HTTP+SSE.

**Goal (§4):** the six views rebuilt as a React SPA against the Phase 1 API. Develop in a
plain browser (`uvicorn` + `vite dev`, hot reload, real devtools). Exit = the feature-parity
checklist (§7) ticked in the browser.

> **First slice DONE & verified in-browser: the Workspace (Main Table).** macOS-classic theme
> locked in (design_survey winner). Frontend scaffolded (Vite + React + **TypeScript**),
> `npm run build` clean. Live round-trip proven against the real worker on the
> `CodeMapTest.arch` dataset (35 models, active model 385 rows): virtualized table renders,
> status pills colour correctly, and a Port-State pill edit persists to the DB and re-renders
> green — no console errors.

## Dev workflow

```
# worker (uses the v1 venv; src on PYTHONPATH because backend imports Application_Logic.*)
PYTHONPATH=src ARCH_API_TOKEN=dev-token \
  /Users/alex/Git_Projects/Embeded-Software-Architecture-Validation/.venv/bin/python \
  -m uvicorn backend.app:app --port 8765

# frontend (Vite proxies /api → 127.0.0.1:8765; token from .env.development)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
```

- **Auth in dev:** `frontend/.env.development` sets `VITE_API_TOKEN=dev-token`, which must
  match the worker's `ARCH_API_TOKEN`. In Phase 3 pywebview injects `window.__ARCH_TOKEN__`
  instead (the client prefers that global, falling back to the env var).
- **No project bundled:** point the launcher at an existing `.arch`. Rich dev dataset:
  `/Users/alex/Downloads/GIT/ForTesting/CodeMapTest/CodeMapTest.arch` (35 models; active
  `LedAdapter_SwPkg` = 385 rows; pills are mostly "In Work" + one "Not Reviewed").
  To test editing without mutating real data, copy it to /tmp and open exclusive.

```

**Key design decisions**
- **TypeScript** — the plan calls for a *typed* API client; types mirror the router JSON.
- **Column rendering from `logic_key`, no Qt classes.** `resolveColumns()` maps each column's
  `type` to a render role. The **match column has type `"Static Text"`** in real data — it's
  identified positionally as *the column immediately after a Port/Function/Variable Search
  column* (mirrors `Logic_Symbol_Matcher.search_specs_from_layout`). Pill palettes
  (Released/In Work/Retired/Deleted; Not Reviewed/In Review/Reviewed/Broken Link) ported
  verbatim from `src/UI/column_types.py`.
- **Virtualized from day one** (§9 risk): TanStack Virtual over a `<table>` with top/bottom
  spacer rows; `?limit=5000` page (server is already paged for bigger sets).
- **Three reusable API primitives** (§4.1): `client` fetch wrapper, `useSSE`, `useResource`.
  Reads refetch wholesale on SSE `db-changed`/`lock` rather than caching — simplicity first.
- **No right-click-only actions** (§4.2): every row action is in the visible kebab (⋯) menu
  AND the inspector strip; pills edit via left-click dropdown.

## Verified in-browser (this slice)

- Launcher opens a project (view + exclusive); status gate swaps to the workspace shell.
- Sidebar lists 35 models with live row-count badges; clicking switches the active model.
- Virtualized table renders the 385-row model smoothly; horizontal scroll exposes all columns.
- Status pills colour correctly: red "Not Reviewed", yellow "In Work" (+ green "Released" after edit).
- View-only mode: banner shown, pills non-editable (no ▾), write controls disabled.
- Exclusive mode: pill dropdown → `PATCH /models/{id}/ports/{row}` → **persisted to DB** →
  pill re-renders green. Save, Add Port, Re-match enabled.
- No console errors/warnings; `npm run build` (tsc + vite) clean.

## TODO — remaining Workspace parity (§7) before moving to other views

- Column customizer (add/remove/reorder/rename/hide; TC. ID pinned; reviewed-column locking)
  — backend needs the rename/delete validation rules extracted to logic (noted in Phase-0
  `column_customizer.py` header) so the API can enforce server-side.
- Fuzzy match candidate picker (the `GET /api/symbols` dropdown with scores) + manual-override
  (purple) tracking surfaced in the cell.
- Model management dialog (create/rename/duplicate/soft-delete/restore) — APIs exist.
- Port-state propagation confirmation UI (#8.2) — the two-step `/state/preview` → `/state`
  flow when a *model's* status changes (distinct from per-row pill edits, which are plain PATCH).
- Excel/InterfaceExport import wizard (compose `/import/analyze` + `/ports/bulk` + `fuzzy_rematch`).
- Retired/deleted visibility toggle; symbol filter; release results columns; baselines (create/load/compare).
- Job progress UI: a `useJob(kind)` hook wrapping start/poll(SSE)/cancel (plan §4.1 #3) —
  re-match / generate / parse-elf currently fire-and-forget with a toast.

## Then (later Phase 2 slices, plan §4 view order)

Code Map (ELK.js/React Flow + source pane, #2C/#2D) → Change Log (Monaco diff + AI summary) →
Test Design (CodeMirror template + live preview) → AI Generation + AI Chat (provider config,
SSE streaming, mind-map status, requirements import). Then Phase 3 (pywebview shell).

## Session log

- **2026-06-13 (a)** — Scaffolded `frontend/` (Vite + React + TS; deps `@tanstack/react-table`,
  `@tanstack/react-virtual`, `@types/node`). Built the macOS-classic theme, the three API
  primitives, typed resource hooks, the Launcher, and the full Workspace (titlebar, sidebar,
  virtualized ports table with editable status pills, inspector, status bar, banners, toast).
  `npm run build` clean. Verified the live round-trip in the preview browser against the real
  worker (`CodeMapTest.arch`): render, model switch, pill edit → DB persist → green re-render,
  no console errors. `.claude/launch.json` adds a `frontend` config (npm run dev :5173).
- **2026-06-13 (b)** — UX polish per Alex: **resizable table columns** (header/body vertical
  separators + drag grips on each header right-edge; widths in local state, seeded from the
  layout — persisting via PUT /columns deferred to the column customizer) and a **resizable
  sidebar** (drag divider, clamped 170–480px). Both verified by simulated drag in the browser
  (column +90px, sidebar +70px) and screenshot; `npm run build` clean.
- **2026-06-13 (c)** — **Start screen + folder picker** (Alex: "replace launcher first" +
  "backend folder picker"). New backend router `backend/routers/fs.py` — read-only
  `GET /api/fs/list` (dirs + .arch only, dotfiles hidden) + `GET /api/fs/home`, token-guarded,
  the dev stand-in for Phase-3 native dialogs (6 tests, `Tests/test_backend_fs.py`). Frontend:
  `StartScreen` (New/Open cards + recent-projects list from localStorage) replaces the old
  typed-path `Launcher` (deleted); `FolderPicker` modal browses real folders, selects an .arch
  (exclusive/view), or picks a destination + filename for New. Verified in-browser: navigate
  4 levels → select → open (view-only) → lands in Workspace (35 models) → recent recorded →
  reload shows it. Full suite **585 passed** (579 + 6 fs); `npm run build` clean; no console
  errors. **NEXT: the dedicated New-Project create form** (ELF/source/release/first-model setup).
- **2026-06-13 (d)** — Onboarding polish per Alex: (1) **New Folder** in the picker —
  `POST /api/fs/mkdir` (rejects separators / existing; +3 tests) wired to a "＋ New Folder"
  affordance in New mode; (2) **Miller-columns** (Finder-style) picker — `FolderPicker` rewritten
  from a single list to a horizontal strip of folder listings (click a folder → next column opens
  to its right; deepest column auto-scrolls into view); (3) **view-only is now the default** open
  mode — picker checkbox flipped to "Open for editing (exclusive lock)", and a recent's main click
  opens view-only with a ✏️ secondary action for exclusive. All verified in-browser (drill 5 cols
  deep → open view-only; New Folder → create project inside → exclusive). Full suite **588 passed**
  (+3 mkdir); `npm run build` clean; no console errors.
