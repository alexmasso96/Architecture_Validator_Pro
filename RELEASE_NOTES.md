# v1.0.2

## 🔍 Fixed: imported & ELF-switched rows now fuzzy-match immediately

Previously, when you imported a InterfaceExport/Excel architecture export and mapped
operations or ports into a **Search** column, the adjacent **(Match)** column did
not actually perform the fuzzy search — it only mirrored the raw text copied from
the search column. The match scoring was deferred to a *lazy* dropdown that only
ran when you manually opened each cell, so freshly imported rows showed no
suggestions or scores until you clicked through every one of them.

**Cause.** Imported and loaded rows were rendered through the lazy widget path,
which pre-fills the (Match) cell with the search text but never invokes the
matcher until the dropdown is opened. Typing into a cell by hand used the eager
path; importing did not.

**Fix.** Imports and ELF switches now run the **active (eager) matcher branch**,
so the (Match) columns are filled with real fuzzy results (with match percentages)
the moment the data lands:

- **Importing** an architecture export now eagerly matches every row against the
  loaded symbols. An *"Importing — matching symbols"* progress window is shown so
  it's clear work is happening on large imports.
- **Loading a different ELF** from the Release Selection window now re-runs the
  matcher against the new symbol set automatically. The redundant **Deep Search**
  checkbox (which had no effect) was removed.
- **Opening a saved project** intentionally keeps the lighter lazy path, and now
  always matches against the last loaded ELF for that project.

Baselines remain read-only snapshots — their stored matches are left untouched.

## 🧱 Fixed: columns disappeared when force-reloading an ELF

Loading/force-reloading a release's ELF from the **Release Selection** window
could wipe the entire table — every column vanished, leaving only the left
row-number gutter.

**Cause.** A Software Release stores only its row data, never the column schema
(columns belong to the architecture model). When the release was loaded, that
schema-less data was fed to the table restore path, which rebuilt the layout
from an *empty* configuration and so removed every column. This surfaced after
the SQLite migration, where release data no longer carries a column list.

**Fix.** The restore path now keeps the current column schema when no
configuration is supplied (releases inherit the model's columns and only overlay
their rows). A genuine layout change — e.g. loading a baseline — still rebuilds
as before. As a side effect, eager fuzzy matching on ELF switch now works,
because the columns it matches against are no longer destroyed first.

## 🔁 Fixed: (Match) column stayed empty for other models on import

The eager-match fix above only populated the **(Match)** column for the model
that happened to be on screen. Imports spread rows across several models (one per
sheet), and newly created models aren't the active one — so every other imported
model still showed raw search text until each dropdown was opened by hand.

**Fix.** Import now runs the eager matcher for **every model that received rows**
and saves the results into each, so switching to any imported model shows real
fuzzy matches immediately. Applies to both Excel and InterfaceExport imports.

> Note: opening a saved project still uses the lighter lazy path and matches
> against the ELF that was active when the project was last saved.

## 🖱️ Fixed: sidebar buttons silently dead after a long matching pass (macOS)

On macOS, the **"Importing — matching symbols"** loading window could leave the
left-hand sidebar buttons unresponsive until the app was restarted — the model
list still scrolled, but clicks did nothing.

**Cause.** The loading window was shown **application-modal** but via
`show()` / `close()` (not `exec()`). Matching runs synchronously on the UI
thread, so the modal session bought nothing, and on macOS that mismatched
modal lifecycle left a *dangling modal session* that swallowed sidebar clicks.

**Fix.** The matching/import progress window is now **non-modal** (the
synchronous loop already blocks interaction), so no stray modal session is left
behind. Applies to both the import pass and the standalone fuzzy-match refresh.

## ✨ UI: larger, easier-to-click architecture-model rows

The model rows in the left sidebar now have more padding and a taller hit area,
giving a comfortably larger click target when selecting the active model.

# v1.0.1 — Hotfix

## 🔒 Fixed: repeated master-password prompts ("integrity mismatch")

Opening a project frequently asked for the master password — claiming an
**integrity mismatch** — even on a normal save → close → reopen, and especially
after rebuilding or moving the app.

**Cause.** Project integrity was verified by hashing the **entire raw bytes of
the `.arch` SQLite file** and storing that hash in a separate `.integrity`
sidecar. SQLite files are not byte-stable for unchanged content: WAL
checkpoints on close, the file change counter, and version fields in the header
all rewrite bytes that have nothing to do with your data. The app also commits
to the database outside of an explicit save (UI state, history). So the bytes
changed on nearly every reopen and the check failed — a false alarm, not real
tampering.

**Fix.** Integrity is now an **HMAC over the project's canonical *logical*
content** (models, rows, layout, releases, test-case design, …), keyed by the
master-password hash, and stored **inside the database** so it travels with the
file. It ignores SQLite's internal bookkeeping and volatile/cosmetic tables, so
it is stable across reopen and across SQLite versions while remaining
tamper-evident. Existing projects open silently and are re-stamped on the next
save; the old `.integrity` sidecar is cleaned up automatically.

You should no longer be prompted for the master password unless a project's
content was genuinely modified outside the app (or you enter Test Mode, which is
password-gated by design).

## 📦 Build

- Stopped bundling the full PyQt6 package as data files, which was overriding
  PyInstaller's pruning and roughly doubling artifact size (macOS `.app`
  ~281 MB → ~138 MB). No functional change.
