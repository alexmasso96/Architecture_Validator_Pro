## What is this tool, in one paragraph?

Embedded teams maintain an architecture — ports, interfaces, operations — that's supposed to reflect what's actually compiled into the ECU. Keeping those two in sync is normally slow and manual. Architecture Validator Pro parses the compiled `.elf` binary, fuzzy-matches your architecture ports to the real symbols in the firmware, and gives you an editable table to review and sign off on everything. From there you can track changes between software releases, keep a reviewable history, and generate low-level test case designs straight from your data.

## A quick tour of the demo project

The screenshots throughout this guide come from a sample project ([`Resources/Demo/Demo_Project.arch`](../../Resources/Demo/Demo_Project.arch)) with two architecture models — `DoorControl_ECU` and `BatteryMgmt_ECU` — and two releases. Open it yourself to follow along.
