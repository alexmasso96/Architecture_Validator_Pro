# 🏛️ Architecture Validator Pro

A cross-platform desktop tool for validating embedded software architecture against the compiled binary it ships in.

Point it at an `.elf` file and an architecture export, and it parses the binary's debug info, fuzzy-matches your architecture ports to the real symbols in the firmware, and gives you an editable table to review, track, and sign off on everything. From there you can detect changes between software releases, keep a reviewable history, and generate low-level test case designs straight from your architecture data.

Built as a React single-page app in a native **pywebview** desktop shell over a local **FastAPI** worker, with a Qt-free Python logic core and a native Rust ELF parser.

## Why it exists

Embedded teams maintain an architecture (ports, interfaces, operations) that's supposed to reflect what's actually compiled into the ECU. Keeping those two in sync is normally a slow, manual, error-prone job — diffing symbol names by hand, re-checking everything on every software release, and writing low-level test cases by review.

Architecture Validator Pro automates the tedious parts so you can focus on the decisions: *is this match correct, and has anything changed since the last release?*

## Features

### 🔍 ELF / DWARF binary parsing (native Rust + Python fallback)
Reads compiled `.elf` files and pulls out the symbols, functions, structures, and global variables from the DWARF debug info. A bundled **native Rust parser** (`rust_elf_parser`, a PyO3 extension built with maturin) does this with parallel traversal and `mmap`; if the native module isn't present it falls back transparently to `pyelftools`. Includes disassembly-based sub-call analysis (via Capstone) and caches parsed data so large binaries only get the slow treatment once.

The native parser handles **relocatable objects (`.o`)** as well as linked images, and its output is sanity-checked: if it ever looks corrupted, the app discards it and re-parses with `pyelftools` rather than trusting it. The Release Manager shows which backend produced each release's data (**⚙ native** / **⚙ python**), and `ARCH_PARSER_BACKEND=python` forces the Python backend for troubleshooting.

### 🤖 AI test-case generation, agentic chat & mind maps
Generate **low-level, HiL-debugger-style test designs** from your high-level test cases and the real C source, across **GitHub Copilot, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini** — or a **self-hosted Ollama or vLLM** server, so source code never leaves your infrastructure (keys and endpoints stored encrypted, per-user, never in the project). An **Advanced AI Chat** indexes your source into a compact **mind map** and answers questions agentically with read-only, sandboxed tools (`read_file`, `search_code`, `get_call_graph`, …) — grounded in the actual code. Import requirements (CSV/XLSX) and compute file-by-file source diffs between releases.

![AI Test Generation — low-level HiL test designs from high-level cases](/Media/images/ai_test_generation.png "AI Test Generation — generate low-level, HiL-debugger-style test designs from your high-level test cases and the real C source")

![Advanced AI Chat — agentic Q&A grounded in the firmware](/Media/images/advanced_ai_chat.png "Advanced AI Chat — answers questions agentically with read-only, sandboxed tools, grounded in the source mind map and call graph")

### 🗺️ Code Map
A visual **call-graph + source explorer** that joins the ELF/DWARF facts (addresses, sizes, params, structs, globals) to the C source by function name — depth-bounded caller/callee graph, matched-globals panel, and a syntax-highlighted source view. Rebuildable offline (no AI tokens).

**Object-file enrichment.** Point the Code Map's **Objects** badge at your build-output folder of `.o` files and the compiler's own relocation records confirm the call graph: edges the compiler really emitted are drawn **solid**, edges seen only in the source text (e.g. a call inside a disabled `#ifdef`) are drawn **dashed**. Because this needs no disassembly, it works on targets the disassembler doesn't support (e.g. RH850). Functions the optimizer **inlined** — which run but have no symbol of their own — are recovered from the debug info and offered in the match picker tagged *inlined*, so a port isn't reported missing just because its function was inlined. The linked ELF remains the primary import; object files only add information.

![Code Map — call-graph explorer joined to the C source](/Media/images/code_map.png "Code Map — depth-bounded caller/callee graph with function details, matched globals, and a syntax-highlighted source view")

### 📜 Change Log
A **git-style side-by-side diff** between releases (file browser, old/new with synchronized scrolling and add/delete highlighting), plus an optional AI-generated change-log summary.

![Change Log — side-by-side release diff](/Media/images/change_log.png "Change Log — git-style side-by-side diff between releases with synchronized scrolling and add/delete highlighting")

### 💉 Source-level test injection
Splice extra C code — instrumentation, stubs, a test harness — into your firmware **without ever editing the real source files**. Edits are saved as *hooks* in the project (anchored to the surrounding lines, not brittle line numbers) and applied only to generated copies. Import helper `.c/.h` files alongside, then **export** build-ready code — *Modified files only* or a full *Reconstructed* tree — with your originals left untouched.

### 📥 Flexible architecture import
Bring your architecture in from **Excel or CSV**. InterfaceExport path-based exports are detected automatically and routed through a dedicated import flow, and the classic sheet-per-model spreadsheet format is supported too.

**Import Profiles** handle every other format without code: build a reusable profile from declarative rules — *filter* rows, *derive* a column from if/else conditions, *split* a cell (e.g. a `::` path), *expand* multi-value cells into rows, *partition* into one model per value, *clean* values (incl. filling merged cells) — then map columns onto the table. A **live preview** runs against a sample file read once into memory and shows what each table column will receive, with per-rule row counts and a *show all rows* view for cross-checking. A profile can **append** rows or **match and update** existing ones by a key (e.g. fill a test-case ID into every function row of an interface). Every import shows a **diff before anything is written**. Profiles are auto-selected by filename pattern (e.g. `INTERFACE_EXPORT_*.xls*`).

### 🧩 Fuzzy symbol matching
Maps each architecture port to the closest real symbol in the binary using fuzzy string matching with a **configurable confidence threshold** — so you stay in control of how strict the matching is.

### 📊 Editable, customizable table
All your data lives in one editable table of ports × columns. A drag-and-drop column customizer lets you add, remove, reorder, and rename columns. Built-in column types cover port/function/variable search, matched symbols, init/cyclic execution info, review status, port state, and per-release validation results.

Cells filled by an import (such as test-case IDs) are **locked 🔒**: they can't be edited by hand, and later imports won't overwrite them — a differing value is flagged in the import diff instead. Unlocking is an explicit right-click action recorded in the history.

### 🔁 Release management, baselining & change detection
Manage multiple **software releases** in a single project, each carrying its own ELF data. Creating a release **auto-baselines** the previous one; frozen baselines are read-only and **write-protected at the database layer**, and unfreezing requires the project master password. Compare against a baseline to surface changes — differences are colour-coded so you can **approve or reject** them release over release, and every freeze/unfreeze is recorded in history.

### 🗂️ Multiple architecture models
Organise a project into several architecture models with full lifecycle support: create, duplicate, reorder, soft-delete, and restore.

### 📝 Test Case Design
Author low-level test case templates and generate them across your architecture:

- **Live preview** that updates as you type, row by row, so you always see the real output.
- An easy-to-learn **scripting language built on Markdown** — write standard Markdown, drop in `[Column]` tokens that resolve to your table data, and use inline `#if` conditionals to include or exclude content per row.
- Smart **autocomplete** for column tokens, operators, and values, plus an in-app help/reference dialog.
- **Bulk or individual exports** — generate for the current model or for every model at once.
- Operation grouping options (one test case per port, or one per operation).

![Test Case Design with live preview](/Media/images/screenshot_testcase_design.png "Test Case Design — template editor and live preview")

### 🕒 History & audit trail
A built-in history view tracks changes over the life of the project — each entry records the user, timestamp and release. The change log is **release-scoped**, obfuscated at rest, and protected by an **append-only HMAC hash-chain** so edits/deletions/reordering are detectable.

### 🔒 Collaboration-safe editing
Projects use file locking with an **Exclusive Edit / View-Only** model, so a teammate opening a project that's already being edited sees who holds the lock instead of clobbering each other's work. View-only is enforced server-side (the worker opens the database read-only), and if the lock is lost the session drops to view-only automatically so you can't overwrite someone else's edits.

### 💾 Single-file projects
A project is one portable `.arch` file (a SQLite database under the hood), keeping ELF data, releases, baselines, and history together in one place.

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (a virtual environment is recommended)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Build the React frontend (the worker serves it inside the desktop shell)
( cd src/frontend && npm ci && npm run build )

# 3. Launch the desktop app (pywebview shell over the FastAPI worker)
PYTHONPATH=src python -m desktop.main
```

### Building a distributable

The desktop app is packaged as a PyInstaller onedir bundle from
`ArchitectureValidatorDesktop.spec` (builds the SPA + Rust parser wheel first):

- **macOS / Linux:** `scripts/build_desktop.sh`
- **Windows:** `scripts/build_desktop.ps1`

---

## Windows runtime requirements

The native window on Windows is rendered by pywebview's WinForms backend, which
depends on two Microsoft system components that cannot be bundled into the app.
On most Windows 10 (1903+) and Windows 11 machines they're already present; on
older or locked-down/VM images you may need to install them:

| Component | Why | Download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime** | Renders the React UI. Missing or wrong-architecture → a blank **white window** (install the **ARM64** runtime on Windows-on-ARM). | [Evergreen Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/) |
| **.NET Framework 4.7.2+** (x64/x86 machines) | pythonnet / `clr_loader` bootstrap the WebView2 backend through .NET. Missing → `Failed to resolve Python.Runtime.Loader.Initialize`. | [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) |
| **.NET Desktop Runtime 8.0+ ARM64** (Windows-on-ARM only) | Native ARM64 builds run pythonnet on CoreCLR — `clr_loader` has no ARM64 .NET Framework shim. | [Desktop Runtime ARM64](https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/windowsdesktop-runtime-win-arm64.exe) |

The app **checks for these at launch** and, if one is missing, shows a dialog
linking straight to the download page instead of failing silently. If startup
still fails, a full traceback is written to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ArchitectureValidator\crash.log` and shown in an error dialog.

> **Distributing as a zip:** files unzipped from a browser download carry the
> *Mark of the Web*, which makes .NET Framework refuse to load the bundled
> `Python.Runtime.dll` (`Failed to resolve Python.Runtime.Loader.Initialize`).
> The app now strips these marks from its own bundled assemblies at startup;
> for older builds, right-click the zip → Properties → **Unblock** before
> extracting (or `dir -Recurse | Unblock-File` in PowerShell).

### Building / developing on Windows-on-ARM

Native ARM64 Python needs two pywebview payload fixups (CoreCLR-compatible
WebView2 assemblies + a folder-dialog patch). After `pip install -r
requirements.txt`, run once per venv:

```powershell
python scripts/setup_windows_arm64.py
```

> **Note:** the app stores its WebView2 profile under
> `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ArchitectureValidator\WebView2`, so it runs as a normal user —
> no need to "Run as administrator" even when launched from a read-only location.
